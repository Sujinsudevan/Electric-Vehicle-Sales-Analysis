## Introduction

The dataset used for the electric vehicle (EV) population analysis contains over 150,000 records, capturing various details about electric vehicles mostly in the state of Washington, USA. The key variables include vehicle details such as County, City, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, Electric Range, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility.

## Key Variables

- **Electric Vehicle Type**: Identifies whether the vehicle is a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
- **Electric Range**: Indicates the vehicle's electric-only driving range.
- **CAFV Eligibility**: Reflects whether a vehicle qualifies for clean fuel incentives.
- **Make and Model**: Provides insights into the popularity of specific vehicle manufacturers and models.

## Key Findings

- **Distribution of Electric Vehicles by Type**: The dashboard highlights a higher prevalence of BEVs compared to PHEVs, reflecting the growing trend of purely electric vehicles in the market.
- **Make and Model Popularity**: Tesla dominates the electric vehicle landscape, with the Model 3 being one of the most popular models, followed by other manufacturers like Hyundai, Jeep, and BMW.
- **Electric Range**: Vehicles with longer electric ranges tend to be more popular, which shows a preference for models that reduce range anxiety, an important factor for EV adoption.
- **CAFV Eligibility**: A significant portion of electric vehicles are eligible for clean fuel incentives, making them more attractive to eco-conscious buyers.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the electric vehicle population reveals the dominance of BEVs, with Tesla leading the market in terms of popularity. Longer electric range and eligibility for clean fuel incentives are crucial factors influencing consumer choices. The adoption of electric vehicles is concentrated in urban counties, reflecting the importance of infrastructure and government policies in promoting clean transportation.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of electric vehicle trends, and the findings could be useful for policymakers and automotive industry players to further promote EV adoption and infrastructure development.
